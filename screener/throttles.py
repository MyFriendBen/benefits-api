"""Rate throttles for the screener's AllowAny proxy endpoints.

Split out of `views.py` so `assistant.py` doesn't have to import it for one base class.
That import pulled the PolicyEngine registry, urgent-need calculation, serializers and
webhooks into the assistant module, and made any future `views -> assistant` reference a
startup import cycle.

Rates live in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` (benefits/settings.py), keyed by `scope`.
