# VCR Cassettes - Safe to commit (sensitive data is automatically scrubbed)
#
# These cassettes contain recorded HTTP interactions with sensitive
# information automatically redacted by our conftest.py configuration.
#
# We commit cassettes to:
# - Speed up CI (no need for API credentials)
# - Allow tests to run without external API access
# - Provide reproducible test results

# By default, include all cassette files
!*.yaml
!*.json

# If you need to regenerate cassettes:
# 1. Delete the cassette file
# 2. Set HUD_API_TOKEN in your .env
# 3. Run: pytest -m integration <path_to_test>
# 4. Review the new cassette to ensure no sensitive data leaked
# 5. Commit the updated cassette
