The food packages include items like cereal, pasta, rice, peanut butter, cheese, canned meat, fruits, vegetables, and juice. These packages aren't meant to be a full diet. Instead, they add important nutrients that older adults often don't get enough of, like vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. Seniors in the program also get recipes and tips for healthy eating.",
