        "description": "The Illinois Breast and Cervical Cancer Program (IBCCP) provides free breast and cervical cancer screening services, including mammograms, clinical breast exams, pelvic exams, and Pap tests for eligible women.

Treatment eligibility includes:\n\t• Confirmed medical diagnosis with pathology documentation\n\t• Illinois resident under 65 years old\n\t• Uninsured or underinsured (coverage excludes cancer treatment, lifetime benefit caps met, or limited specialized coverage)\n\t• U.S. citizen or qualified immigrant\n\t• Not eligible for other HFS medical programs (with certain exceptions)",
