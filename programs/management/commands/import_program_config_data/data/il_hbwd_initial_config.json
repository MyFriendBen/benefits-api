        "description": "HBWD is a program that helps people with disabilities get Medicaid health insurance while they have a job. Sometimes, when people earn money from working, they can lose their Medicaid coverage. HBWD helps solve this by letting people with disabilities keep their Medicaid while they work. \n\nMembers pay a small monthly fee (a premium) based on how much they earn. For example, if you make $2,000-$3,000/month: you pay $50-$75. If you make $3,000-$4,000/month: you pay $75-$100. The maximum premium if earning $10,000+ a month is $500. Premiums are lower for income from work than from other sources like disability payments. \n\nClick 'Apply Online' to apply online, download an application to fill out by hand, or call to have one sent to you.",
