        "description": "AABD gives cash each month to people in Illinois who are 65 or older, blind, or disabled. You must have low income and few assets to qualify. The cash can help pay for food, housing, clothes, and other needs.\n\nYou can apply online, in person, by phone, or by mail. Select \"Apply Now\" to see all options. It may take up to 45 days to get this benefit (or 90 days if you must prove you have a disability). \n\nThe estimated value assumes you have less than $2,000 in assets if single, or $3,000 if a couple. Add $50 more for each extra person in your home. Cars worth over $4,500 may count toward this limit. If you cannot get out of bed or a chair for 3 or more months, you may get a higher amount. If you live in a nursing home or care facility, you will get much less (about $60/month).",
