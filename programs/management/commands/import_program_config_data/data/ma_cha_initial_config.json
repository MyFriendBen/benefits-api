Depending on meeting family and income standards, households can receive rental vouchers or public housing locations.\n\nVoucher holders typically pay about 30% of income toward rent, with the subsidy covering the rest up to a cap.\n\nNote: These are waitlists. Submitting an application does not guarantee housing or a voucher. Wait times can be long (often months or years).",
