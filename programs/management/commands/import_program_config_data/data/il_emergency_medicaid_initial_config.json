A medical emergency is when something happens suddenly that could seriously hurt your health if you don't get help right away. Examples include a bad injury, severe chest pain, or trouble breathing.\n\nEmergency Medicaid does NOT cover regular doctor checkups, shots and vaccines, or medical care that can wait.\n\nYou don't need to apply before you have an emergency. If you go to the hospital or emergency room with a medical emergency, the hospital staff will help you find out if Emergency Medicaid can pay for that visit.",
