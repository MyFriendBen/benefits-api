        "description": "CCAP helps families pay for child care while parents are working or going to school. The program covers care for children under 13 years old (or up to 19 with special needs). The state pays a monthly subsidy directly to your child care provider. You pay a monthly copayment (your out-of-pocket cost) to the provider based on your family income and size. Together, the subsidy and your copayment cover the cost of care at licensed providers, including daycare centers, home-based care, and after-school programs.\n\nThe estimated value shows what you save (subsidy minus your copayment). You may qualify for lower copayments:\n\n• Your copayment may be $0/month (saving you $444-$10,000+/year more) if your family:\n\t◦ Is getting TANF cash assistance (child-only)\n\t◦ Is experiencing homelessness\n\t◦ Is completing DCFS Intact Family Services\n\t◦ Is active military with deployed family member\n\t◦ Includes foster youth who are parents\n\t◦ Is getting Extended Family Support services\n\n• Your copayment may be $1/month (saving you $432-$10,000+/year more) if your parent/guardian is working in child care.\n\n• Your copayment may be 50% off (saving you $222-$5,000+/year more) if all your children are school-age (5-13) in part-time care during the school year (Sept-May).\n\nNote: This estimate is for new applications. Copayments are based on your income and family size at the time of eligibility determination.",
