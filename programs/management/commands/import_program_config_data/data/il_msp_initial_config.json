        "description": "Medicare is health insurance for people 65 and older. It is also for younger people with some disabilities. Medicare has two main parts:\n- Part A helps pay for hospital stays.\n- Part B helps pay for doctor visits.\n\nPeople pay a monthly fee called a premium to keep their Medicare. MSP helps pay these premiums if you have a low income.\n\nHow much help you get depends on your income:\n- Very low income: MSP pays your Part A and Part B premiums, plus your deductibles (the amount you pay before Medicare starts paying) and the copayments and coinsurance you pay when you get care.\n- A little higher income: MSP pays your Part B premium only.\n\nThe estimated savings shown above only includes your premium savings. Your actual savings could be much higher if you qualify for the very low income level, which also covers your deductibles and other costs when you get care.\n\nThe estimated savings shown above assume you or your spouse worked at least 10 years, which automatically makes Part A free. This is true for about 99% of people with Medicare.\n\nTo apply, you must already be enrolled in Medicare. Click 'Apply Now' to learn how to apply online, by mail, by phone, or in person.",
