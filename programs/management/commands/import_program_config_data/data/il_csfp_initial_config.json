        "description": "CSFP helps low-income seniors eat healthier by giving them free food each month. The food packages include items like cereal, pasta, rice, peanut butter, cheese, canned meat, fruits, vegetables, and juice. These packages aren't meant to be a full diet. Instead, they add important nutrients that older adults often don't get enough of, like vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. Seniors in the program also get recipes and tips for healthy eating.",
