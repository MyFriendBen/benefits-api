        "description": "CCAP helps families pay for child care while parents are working or going to school. The program covers care for children under 13 years old (or up to 19 with special needs). The state pays a monthly subsidy directly to your child care provider. You pay a monthly copayment (your out-of-pocket cost) to the provider based on your family income and size. Together, the subsidy and your copayment cover the cost of care at licensed providers, including daycare centers, home-based care, and after-school programs.",
