        "description": "CCAP helps families pay for child care while parents are working or going to school. The program covers care for children under 13 years old (or up to 19 with special needs). The state pays a monthly subsidy directly to your child care provider. You pay a monthly copayment (your out-of-pocket cost) to the provider based on your family income and size. Together, the subsidy and your copayment cover the cost of care at licensed providers, including daycare centers, home-based care, and after-school programs.\n\n💰 The estimated value shows what you save (subsidy minus your copayment). You may qualify for lower copayments:\n\n• $0/month (save $444-$10,000+/year more) - Families who are getting TANF cash assistance (child-only), experiencing homelessness, completing DCFS Intact Family Services, active military with deployed family member, foster youth who are parents, or getting Extended Family Support services.\n\n• $1/month (save $432-$10,000+/year more) - Families with a parent/guardian working in child care.\n\n• 50% off (save $222-$5,000+/year more) - Families with all children school-age (5-13) in part-time care during school year (Sept-May).\n\nNote: This estimate is for new applications. If you already get CCAP and are reapplying, you may pay less.",
