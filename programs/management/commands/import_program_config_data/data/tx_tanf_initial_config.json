    "description": "TANF provides cash assistance and support for families. Most TANF participants must have a job, look for work, volunteer in the community, or take part in education or job-skills training. To qualify, you must be pregnant or have a dependent child living in your home.\n\nThe maximum grant amount for your household depends on the number of adults and children in the home. To receive TANF, you must cooperate with child support services and assign to the state any rights you have to receive child support. A local agency will conduct an interview with you. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) may affect your household's eligibility for TANF.",
