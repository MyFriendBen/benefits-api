Your nurse will teach you about pregnancy, labor, your baby's growth, healthy eating, shots your baby needs, and resources in your community. This help has been shown to improve children's health and development, reduce premature births and low birthweight babies, and strengthen the bond between parents and babies. This program is for first-time pregnancies only. Further income requirements may apply.",
